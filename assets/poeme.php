        <p>Jean-Claude Van Damme, the man of might,</p>
        <p>With muscles toned and shining bright,</p>
        <p>He moves with grace, he strikes with power,</p>
        <p>His kicks and punches shake the tower.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Born in Belgium, he started young,</p>
        <p>Training hard until his skills were sprung,</p>
        <p>From martial arts to film career,</p>
        <p>He conquered hearts, he knew no fear.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>In "Bloodsport" he was the hero,</p>
        <p>In "Kickboxer" he fought the foe,</p>
        <p>Universal Soldier" showed his might,</p>
        <p>And "Timecop" took us to new heights.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>His splits, his flips, his roundhouse kicks,</p>
        <p>They all leave us in awe and fix,</p>
        <p>Our eyes on him, our hearts ablaze,</p>
        <p>As he dominates the screen and amaze.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>With every role he takes on board,</p>
        <p>He shows us what a star is formed,</p>
        <p>For Jean-Claude Van Damme, we cheer,</p>
        <p>Legend of action, always near.</p>
